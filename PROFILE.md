## Interests
I am a person who loves to try new things so I have a few hobbies and they're quite diverse. I love to paint and draw, this was my first hobby as a young child. I then got really interested in video games and playstation and it is still one of my favourite hobbies to this day. Cooking is something I picked up along the way in my teenage years that I enjoy but I am still improving. My most recent interest is working out at the gym, I have finally started to feel like I am enjoying it rather than torturing myself so I would like to see my interests in different exercises grow.
