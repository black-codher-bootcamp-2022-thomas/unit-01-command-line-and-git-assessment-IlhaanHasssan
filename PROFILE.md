ðŸ‘‹ Hello, my name is Ilhaan, pronounced ***ill-haan***, *have a look at my avatar*(https://github.com/black-codher-bootcamp-2022-thomas/unit-01-command-line-and-git-assessment-IlhaanHasssan/blob/main/image/avatar.jpeg)

## Bio
I previously studied biology briefly and I am now transitioning into a full-stack developer role. I love cooking, video games and painting in my spare time. I enjoy coding and I am currently part of the Thomas cohort with BlackCodher and Goldman Sachs with high hopes of going on to a tech role.
## Education

- *3 A-levels*: *Biology, Chemistry and Geography*
- *12 GCSEs: *All A* - C*
## Interests
I am a person who loves to try new things so I have a few hobbies and they're quite diverse. I love to paint and draw, this was my first hobby as a young child alongside reading. I then got really interested in video games and playstation and it is still one of my favourite hobbies to this day. Cooking is something I picked up along the way in my teenage years that I enjoy but I am still improving. My most recent interest is working out at the gym, I have finally started to feel like I am enjoying it rather than torturing myself so I would like to see my interests in different exercises grow.
## ***My top 5 favourite TV shows/movies:***
